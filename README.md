# Better Console Applications

Slidedeck: https://speakerdeck.com/el_stoffel/better-console-applications

Console applications - whether part of a larger (Symfony-)application or standalone-tool - usually are the bash-script of PHP developers. Thereby one often leaves the path of clean code and hacks a very pragmatic solution. Despite the fact that a lot of these fast solutions remain in project and need to be maintained for longer. What to reason about while developing a console application and which simple tricks help to clean up your code, is shown by examples in this talk. How do I decouple my code from CLI runtime, how do I optimize long running processes and so on.

Start with branch `00/kickoff` and see pull requests for refactoring steps.
